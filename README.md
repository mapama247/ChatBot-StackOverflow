# ChatBot-StackOverflow

Dialog system built as the final project of the Natural Language Processing [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) from HSE.

The goal was to develop a StackOverflow Assistant able to answer programming-related questions and hold conversations on random topics. For the “chit-chat mode”, the conversational bot uses a pre-trained neural network engine called [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot), which ranks Twitter replicas by their relevance.
